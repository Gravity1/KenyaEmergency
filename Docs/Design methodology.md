Chatgpt and I decided these are the first steps needed: (to be refined)

[[Brainstorm]]
## KenyaEmergency Project To-Do List

### 1. Research & Planning

- **Gather Emergency Contacts**
    - Compile a list of essential emergency numbers by category (police, fire brigade, hospitals, KWS, coast guard, etc.).
    - Organize by location-based categories, especially relevant for unique areas (e.g., national parks, coastal regions).
    - Identify any sources that might allow for real-time updates or reports, which could be phased in later.
- **Define Location Categories**
    - Establish geographic and need-based categories (e.g., anti-terrorism, wildlife management) to guide users to the most relevant contacts.
- **Determine Storage Solution**
    - Evaluate options for data storage (SQL, Firebase, or JSON files).
    - Consider performance and scalability for fast access across different regions.
- **Outline User-Contributed Content Structure**
    - Document potential designs for user input systems (optional).
    - Sketch out a voting/rating feature to ensure information accuracy if user-generated content is integrated later.
- **Documentation Preparation**
    - Set up a GitHub repository for version control, and create README and LICENSE files.
    - Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file if planning to invite contributions in the future.

### 2. Design & Wireframing

- **Landing Page Design**
    - Prioritize simplicity and clear access to high-priority emergency numbers.
    - Plan quick links for popular emergency services based on location or urgency.
- **Location-Based Suggestions**
    - Mock up how location-specific suggestions might appear (use a sidebar or map for visual clarity).
    - Design intuitive icons for each emergency service to improve navigation.
- **Search Functionality Design**
    - Plan a universal search bar with filters by service type and location.
    - Draft user flow for quick and intuitive searching.
- **User Contribution Flow (Optional)**
    - Design user submission and voting features for potential phase 2.

### 3. Development

- **Backend Development**
    - Create a database schema or JSON structure for emergency contact data.
    - Implement APIs or direct data access for fast retrieval.
- **Geolocation Integration**
    - Integrate a location API for device-based location customization.
    - Design logic to prioritize results based on geolocation.
- **Frontend UI Development**
    - Develop a responsive, lightweight frontend that works well on mobile and desktop.
    - Optimize load times to enhance accessibility in low-bandwidth areas.
- **Search System Implementation**
    - Create an indexed search function for quick results.
    - Plan category tags and keywords for better search accuracy.
- **User Contribution System (Optional)**
    - Design backend for storing user submissions and rating information.
    - Implement logic to flag or approve user-generated entries based on votes.

### 4. Testing & Launch

- **Functional Testing**
    - Test backend functionalities (geolocation, database retrieval).
    - Test search functionality across multiple search terms and filter options.
- **Load Testing**
    - Check page loading speeds to ensure a light and fast experience.
- **Beta Launch**
    - Deploy the site to a limited audience for feedback.
    - Collect feedback on usability, speed, and accuracy of results.
- **Final Adjustments & Go Live**
    - Implement feedback, fine-tune performance, and prepare for a public launch.

### 5. Documentation & Promotion

- **GitHub Documentation**
    - Maintain clear commit messages to document changes.
    - Write a README with project background, goals, and setup instructions.
    - Include a future roadmap for planned features and improvements.
- **Wikipedia Article**
    - Write an initial draft about the project, including its purpose, inspiration, and societal benefit.
    - Plan sections on categories covered, unique features (e.g., location-based services), and any user contributions.
