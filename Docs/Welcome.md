Hi there!

## Why KenyaEmergency? 🌍💡

I called 999 when a gas cylinder nearly blew up our hostel. I was transferred severally until the last guy (whom I assumed to be a police officer) said, "Mimi si mechanic". Which is true. It is only when we thought about the nearest fire brigade to Juja and search for the numbers.

I think this is an easy enough task, I intend on doing it over the course of a weekend. Let us see how it goes. Feel free to contribute.
