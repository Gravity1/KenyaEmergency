I want these features, ... just because:

1. [[Information on Kenya's emergency services]] and contacts (managed by wikipedia)
2. Webpage that makes it convenient for users (people in danger). So it is intuitive and fast
	1. A location feature that maps nearest services available. Cater to fastest routes considering traffic jams, accidents etc.
3. Is it possible to interface with these emergency services? Like they can see someone in the process of looking for help on the website, and be planning emergency routes etc? IDK might have to talk to actual professionals in the field.
4. I guess it would be wise to include training/research materials and tools. Like there are emergency features for most android and ios phones that are now gaining the ability to contact emeregency services/persons without sim card data or wifi. For lost devices etc. So a quick way of educating the user on these on the website is something worth looking into. I am kinda sure that there are premade versions of something like this on the internet.
5. Look into how resources like the android community deal with this issue, specifically what resources, apis, docs, etc they have in place and how those can be used here.
6. Costs. Ironically, many people are wary of the costs of these things. Enough to not make them call emergency services. I am not spending any time researching this because I have encountered it first hand, have gotten second hand anecdotal evidence, and I can just spend that time adding the dimension of cost to the information on the site. This will most likely be another column on a db.
7. Have a downloadable contacts list that makes it very easy for the user to save the numbers in their address book. So that way they always have the contacts irregardless. This can be something everyone carries around and can share via social media.
8. Early warning and Alerts in Kenya
9. A way for users to simply report (could be useful when they are witnessing something but cannot or will not get involved), separate this (make less prominent) than the call emergency (which is supposed to be the whole point)
10. Look into having a potential avenue for citizens to give information to the government eg to document and respond to things like local county council stuff like a collapsed bridge etc
11. Connect with the national missing persons database
