### KIPPRA
Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) is a public institution that was established in May 1997 through a Legal Notice and commenced operations in June 1999. In January 2007, His Excellency the President signed the KIPPRA Bill into law and the KIPPRA Act No. 15 of 2006 came into effect on 1st February 2007. The Institute is thus a state corporation established by an act of parliament with a primary mandate of providing quality policy advice to the Government of Kenya and other key stakeholders by conducting policy research and analysis and through capacity building in order to contribute to the achievement of national long term development objectives.

They are related in this way:
"Emergency and disaster management is a co-shared function between the national and county governments, which requires adequate coordination and collaboration. County governments are charged with offering emergency medical services, including ambulance services, while the Ministry of Health is the overall body that regulates the emergency medical care." from "https://kippra.or.ke/strengthening-emergency-medical-care-in-kenya/#:~:text=the%20healthcare%20system.-,Ambulances%20response%20capacity,and%20plans%20towards%20emergency%20response."

"Kenya had 16,517 health facilities comprising of 12,821 level 2 (dispensaries and private clinics), 2,712 level 3 (health centres), 958 level 4 (sub-county hospitals), 20 level 5 (county referral hospitals, teaching and referral, and private hospitals) and 6 level 6 (National referral hospitals)."

". Assault is the leading cause of medical emergency as per the Kenya Emergency Medical Care Policy 2020-2030, comprising of 42 per cent of all reported cases. The number of road-related injuries has been rising from 0.6 per cent to 1.9 per cent of all disease-related cases reported between 2018 and 2022 as shown in Table 2. Also, road injuries is the 7th cause of death in Kenya, with estimates showing that a half of deaths and a third of disabilities could be addressed with effective emergency care. Further, accidents and injuries are leading in the Average Length of Stay (ALOS) in hospital, with affected patients spending an average of 22.2 days. The Ministry of Health classifies road accidents and injuries as disease burdens. Road accidents result in injuries and trauma. Injuries cause mortality, disability and even impairment, which have an implication on treatment cost, quality of life and productivity of an individual. These statistics imply a need for agility in response and adequate preparedness. Post-accident crash response (immediate care after an accident up to hospitalization) is an emergency need. This requires an effective emergency medical care system, including handling at the accident scene, ferrying of the victims to hospital and in-hospital care."

## Table 2: Medical Emergencies Related to Road Traffic Accidents (2018-2022)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| No. of Injuries (Road Traffic Accident) | 411,704 | 480,993 | 247,252 | 243,391 | 1,687,525 |
| Injuries (Road Traffic Accident in percentage) | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 1.9 |

**Data source:** Ministry of Health (2023), Kenya Health Information System (KHIS/DHIS2)

"Kenya has made significant progress in ensuring access to emergency medical care, with two policies in place, that is: Kenya Emergency Medical Care Policy 2020-2030 and Kenya Emergency Medical Care Strategy 2020-2025."

" there is need to build county emergency departments to respond to unique local emergency service needs up to sub-county and ward levels. Further, collaboration between communities and emergency care centres to build capacities of the public in handling emergencies through campaigns and targeted trainings are important. By-stander trainings on emergency handling can be targeted on boda-boda operators and public service vehicle drivers. An emergency response framework is needed to respond to flood-related medical emergencies. Water harvesting, building of dykes and opening drainage systems can help reduce the effects of floods. Also, there is need to set up an ambulance database to inform on their numbers and increase the number to meet the ambulance population ratio in line with international standards. More effort could be placed on implementing the policy commitments and expanding coverage of pre-hospital emergency handling structures while strengthening in-hospital systems to be affordable to the less privileged."

Also, very cool:![[Pasted image 20241102140406.png]]![[Pasted image 20241102140424.png]]![[Pasted image 20241102140431.png]]
On Wikipedia this is listed as a search rescue service, consider.
## Non-Government Organizations and Businesses

There is actually a project similar to ours:
## flare.co.ke

"We operate in the market as Flare, but are legally registered as Capsule Global."https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/healthy-cities/solutions/9884


The problem they are trying to solve : ": a 2017 study by the Johns Hopkins International Injury Research Unit found that the average response time in Kenya is an astounding 162 minutes", from this article: https://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/fellow/caitlin-dolkart that quoted this 2017 Study : 
but they say it is built for first responders. I respect these guys' work and so it is first.
![[Pasted image 20241102121506.png]]
Unfortunately, I was not able to find this website during the incident that made me want to build this. Also, while researching, I was only able to find this in a BBC article https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42064067, and even after googling some more, I could only find it after fishing for the company's name from the article. https://flare.co.ke/


But it seems they later turned into a for profit organization, 
more information needed.![[Pasted image 20241102125030.png]]
something very fishy about this whole thing:
![[Pasted image 20241102125121.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241102125128.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241102125200.png]]
Very rounded numbers. I wonder if they are still active.

mailto:info@rescue.co?subject=rescue.co%20inquiry

the api might help us:
![[Pasted image 20241102125458.png]]

I am uncomfortable with these two (resue and flare) being linked, with some people being affiliated with both, it not being founded by Kenyans, and the business model being what it is:

"Our value proposition to each customer segment varies, but we structure packages as follows: 1) we offer facility or employee/member benefit packages to corporates and NGOs, and 2) we offer direct to consumer memberships to individuals, families and households."https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/healthy-cities/solutions/9884

"To access its platform, users subscribe to Rescue.co, an annual membership service catering to corporate, individual, family and school subscriptions, with the average yearly fee for an individual costing $15" https://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/fellow/caitlin-dolkart

This project is meant to be free for everyone but time will tell if they are chill with being involved or not. They have an API which is a step above articles I guess, as well as the experience in the field. I feel like down the line, a discussion will have to be had about renumeration. Is it proper that we exchange "exposure", which actually means a lot to companies, for access to their APIs and knowledge, whoever maintains this will decide, this is just for a coding weekend.

"Flare is mapping all the available water hydrants in the city and recording them on the platform"
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42064067

There is also the possibility that this may actually be perceived as competition?? Slippery slope, I vote not to work with them. It is easier that way.

But it is a startup, and they are worthy.

Thank you Co-founders, Caitlin Dolkart and Maria Rabinovich.
