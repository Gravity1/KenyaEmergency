<h1 align="center">KenyaEmergency 🚨🇰🇪</h1>

Welcome to KenyaEmergency, a project designed to make it easy for anyone in Kenya to quickly find emergency contacts when it matters most. Whether it’s fire, police, medical, wildlife, or coast guard services, KenyaEmergency is here to make sure you’re only a click away from essential help!
Why This Project? 🌍💡

~Ni Kunoma 💀~

In a country with so much diversity in needs and locations, finding a central source of emergency numbers can be tough. KenyaEmergency was inspired by the need for a comprehensive, accessible platform where Kenyans can access the right contacts for the right emergencies, especially those specific to unique locations like national parks or coastal regions.
How It Works 📲🚑

KenyaEmergency is structured to:

    📍 Deliver relevant contacts based on your location.
    🔍 Provide a search function to find numbers quickly.
    🐘 Cover unique emergency needs (like Kenya Wildlife Service near parks).
    🤝 Offer a community-driven way to add and validate numbers.

Plus, this project will be lightweight, fast, and easy to navigate for everyone. The repository includes detailed documentation on how KenyaEmergency was built, with insights on geolocation, backend storage solutions, and responsive design.
